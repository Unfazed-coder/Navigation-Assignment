<!-- Part I
Add files: movies.html, fav-movie.html
At the top of each page, create an H1 with a page title
index.html -> Home
movies.html -> Movies
fav-movie.html -> My Favorite Movie
In each file create an unordered list with three list items
Each list item should be an <a> tag that points to the other two pages we have in our file structure
The “current” page should NOT have an <a> tag! -->

<!-- Part II
In movies.html, create a medium heading which reads ‘Top 5 Favorite Movies’
Create an ordered list for these movies
Each list item should have an absolute link to its IMDB info page
Each link should open in a new tab
(optional) Add an image of the movie to each list item -->

    <p><b>An online database, owned by Amazon, of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online – including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is owned and operated by MMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.</b></p>

   <h2 style="background-color:Orange;" id="Description">Features</h2><hr />
<b><p>The movie and talent pages of MMD are accessible to all internet users, but a registration process is necessary to contribute information to the site.</p>

<p>Most data in the database is provided by volunteer contributors. The site enables registered users to submit new material and edits to existing entries. Users with a proven track record of submitting data are given instant approval for additions or corrections to cast, credits, and other demographics of media product and personalities. However, image, name, character name, plot summaries, and title changes are supposedly screened before publication, and usually take between 24 and 72 hours to appear.</p>

<p>All registered users can choose their own site name, and most operate anonymously. They have a profile page which shows how long a registered user has been a member, as well as personal movie ratings (should the user decide to display them) and, since 2015, "badges" are added representing how many contributions a particular registered user has submitted. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, bios, etc. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb page, then that user/visitor can add photos to that page by enrolling in MMDbPRO. There is no single index of contributors, no index on each profile page of the items contributed, and (except for plot synopses and biographies) no identification of contributors to each product's or person's data pages.</p>

<p>Users are also invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a weighted mean-rating that is displayed beside each title, with online filters employed to deter ballot-stuffing.</p>

<p>In January 2019, MMDb launched a free movie streaming platform called Freedive, an ad-supported service offering Hollywood movie titles and TV shows. Many Freedive titles are licensed from Sony Pictures. Subsequently, in June 2019, Freedive was rebranded as IMDbTV, during the launch of which, the amount of content contained on the platform was tripled.</p></b>
